## ðŸš€ How to Use This Course

1. **Read sequentially** - Each chapter builds on previous knowledge
2. **Practice the code** - Don't just read, implement everything
3. **Experiment** - Try variations and break things to learn
4. **Review security chapters** - Security is not optional
5. **Build projects** - Apply concepts to real-world scenarios

---

## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- This course assumes you already know **React**
- We focus on **connectivity** as the main learning goal
- Both **Axios and Fetch** are covered with real examples
- **Security is emphasized** throughout
- All examples are **production-ready** patterns
