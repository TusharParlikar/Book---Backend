Every code example includes:```



```javascript### 2. **Concept Explanations**

// SECTION: Database Query- Clear, beginner-friendly language

// Purpose: Fetch user with populated profile data- Visual diagrams and analogies

// Why: Relationships between collections need population in MongoDB- Step-by-step breakdowns

const user = await User.findById(userId)

  .populate('profile')  // This loads the profile data### 3. **Backend Code Examples**

  .lean();              // Optimization: returns plain JS object- Express routes

- Database operations

// CONNECTED TO REACT:- Business logic

// The frontend receives this data like:

// { _id: '...', name: 'John', profile: { avatar: '...', bio: '...' } }### 4. **React Integration**
